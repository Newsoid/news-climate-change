            "summary": "Environmental advocacy group Wild Ones warned Long Island residents about the dangers of changing coastlines. Long Island's shorelines were hammered by Superstorm Sandy in 2012, eroding beaches and flooding coastal houses. Since then, shoreline communities need better protection to avoid harm. Wild Ones is working to make native species plants more accessible to homeowners."
