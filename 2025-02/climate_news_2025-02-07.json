January 2024 was the third-warmest on record, with an average temperature of 18.9°C. It was the fourth-driest January since 1901. This pattern of dry and warm weather has raised concerns among meteorologists and climate experts that India's traditional spring season is gradually disappearing. The impact extends beyond temperature changes, affecting agriculture, biodiversity, and cultural traditions associated with seasonal shifts."
