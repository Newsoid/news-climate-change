The complete melting of the Greenland Ice sheet could cause a rise in sea levels by as much as seven meters and disrupt global weather patterns."

It found evidence to back up the theory that during those years, the core slowed down around 2010."

I read the UK Times and looked at the trail of disaster and mismanagement left by the Conservative government and now hastened by Sir Keir Starmer and his Fabian colleagues in UK Labour. Australia, a country that produces almost no greenhouse gases is also rushing headlong toward the net zero cliff and societal disaster. I am hopeful that with a federal election to take place in the next few months, the conservative opposition may take heed of President Trump's success and take Australia out of the green energy global religion."
