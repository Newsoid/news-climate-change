Under current levels of warming, such heat events currently afflict about 2 percent of the Earth's landmass, or about 14 times the size of Texas. For adults over 60, the risk is ten times higher. If average temperatures rise to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, then the regions affected by lethal heat waves will spread."
