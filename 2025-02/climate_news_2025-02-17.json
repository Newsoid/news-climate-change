However, the timelines are forecast to accelerate, so global temperatures are predicted to surpass the threshold sooner than expected.

It's likely to have a more profound impact than when he announced it in 2017 early in his first term. There are fewer countries willing to step up to fill the void left by the US than during Trump's first term, and the US is the world's second-largest greenhouse emitter, accounting for about 11% of global emissions. The previous US absence from the agreement was limited to four months. This time it will last at least three years and one month."
