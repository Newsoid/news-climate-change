It occupies the western third of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with the Dominican Republic to its east, Cuba and Jamaica to its west, and the Bahamas to its north. The country's porous maritime and land borders make it an ideal transit point for drugs. Haiti's location makes it vulnerable to hurricanes and earthquakes. Haiti was a French colony in the 18th century, it revolted in 1791, it declared its independence from France in 1804, and it was occupied by US forces from 1915 to 1934. Jean-Claude Duvalier ruled Haiti as a brutal dictatorship from 1957 to 1986."

Sea surface readings in January were the second-highest on record."
