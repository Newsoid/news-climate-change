Women are in more desperate situations because of the prevailing socio-economic, cultural, and legal disparities. Women play a crucial role in the agricultural sphere. They work as low-paid labourers or unpaid workers on family farms. They lack access to land, credit, agricultural inputs and traditional farming methods. Due to climate change, forests and water sources are depleting. This amplifies their workload and restricts the time allotted to education, community engagement, and income-generating activities. Climate change causes the increase of diseases like malaria, dengue, and cholera in Pakistan."
