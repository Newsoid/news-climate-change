Between 2011 and 2016, the period in which fires were prevalent ranged from one to four months, but between 2017 and 2021, this span ballooned to between six and nine months. Scotland is experiencing the most frequent wildfires, with almost half of them occurring within its borders. Peatlands are responsible for 90% of the carbon emissions attributed to wildfires since 2001. The high carbon loss from peatlands poses a significant threat to both local and global climate goals. Land managers can help combat this issue by ensuring these areas remain wet."
