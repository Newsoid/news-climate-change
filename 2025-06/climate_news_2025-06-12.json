            "summary": "During May and June, temperatures in northern India exceed 40 degrees Celsius. The higher temperatures in urban areas are due to absorption, later re-radiation and heat generation from concrete and stone built up areas. In the past, incoming solar energy was absorbed by soil, used by vegetation for photosynthesis and transpiration, or consumed in evaporation from water bodies. Today, growing concrete expanses reflect and reradiate much of the energy, pushing up the effective temperature further. ACs expel hot exhaust, contributing to local warming, and UV radiation intensifies the blazing sunshine."
