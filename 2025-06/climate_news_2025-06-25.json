Over 7.8 million acres have burned, exceeding the average area burned in a year. Most dominant climate models have failed to incorporate the rising rates of fire activity recorded in the Earth's boreal forests. In a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in early June, a trio of researchers studied the relationship between fire activity, fire-related emissions, and global temperatures between 1997 and 2023. They found that the smoke from all the wildfires could dampen global warming by an estimated 12%."
