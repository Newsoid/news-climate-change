In 2024, over 233,000 people were killed in conflicts and more than 120 million people were displaced due to persecution, conflict, violence, and human rights violations. The economic impact of violence was $19.3 trillion in 2023. Global carbon dioxide emissions are projected to have reached 41.6 gigatonnes in 2024 compared to 40.6 gatatonne in 2022. Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war, total CO2 emissions have reached 230 million tonnes. About 1.1 billion people live in poverty and 218 million live in conflict-affected countries."

Last year, Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park fed villagers who were starved by drought with elephants culled to reduce overpopulation. This year, the nearby community of Mabale is banking on rain-harvesting to help locals grow enough food. President Emmerson Mnangagwa declared a state of disaster last April because of the drought. Climate experts say this kind of extreme weather is only going to get worse. U.S. funding supported a range of projects in Zimbabwe."
