The study found that many climate simulations misrepresent Arctic cloud composition during winter, overestimating the ice and underestimating the liquid water content. The more liquid water clouds contain, the better they are at trapping heat. This finding could help explain why the Arctic has been warming three to four times faster than the global average."
