            "summary": "The recent upgrade of Hurricane Erick to Category 2 is a stark reminder that the era of increasingly severe hurricanes is here. Warmer ocean waters provide more fuel for hurricanes, leading to more powerful winds, increased rainfall, and a higher likelihood of rapid intensification. This translates to more devastating impacts on coastal communities. Governments and communities must work together on long-term solutions, such as developing more resilient infrastructure."

The research brings together data from more than 12,000 regions in 55 countries with a focus on wheat, corn, soybeans, rice, barley and cassava. The study criticizes previous research for failing to realistically estimate how farmers will adapt to a changing climate."
