In eastern Greenland, the peak of the heatwave saw temperatures 3.9 degrees Celsius warmer than those recorded in the preindustrial climate. In Iceland, the unusual heat triggered bituminous bleeding on roads, creating hazardous driving conditions, and sea ice in Greenland broke up."

One of the most immediate consequences of climate change is increased heat, which can directly affect the growth and yield of crops. Even a small increase in average temperature can reduce crop yields by up to 10%. Climate change disrupts traditional weather cycles, causing unpredictable and extreme rainfall patterns. Droughts lead to crop failure and livestock mortality. Flooding damages crops, erodes topsoil, and ruins infrastructure. Pests, fungi, and diseases attack crops and livestock."

The average surface air temperature globally in May 2025 stood at 15.79 degrees Celsius (60.4 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 0.53 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average for the month. April 2025 was also the second-warmest April globally on record. The increase in global temperatures is mainly the result of the continuing burning of fossil fuels, like coal, oil and natural gas. Greek seas are warming faster than usual."
