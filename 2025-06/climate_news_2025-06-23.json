It was held to address some of the most pressing environmental crises facing the region and the planet at large. The conference provided a platform for stakeholders to assess current conditions and mobilize coordinated solutions. Somalia allocates nearly 0.5% of its GDP into addressing climate change and environmental challenge. Somalia is one of the lowest emitters of CO2, but it is disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change"
