The orthodox predictions assumed about one-tenth of a degree of warming every five years. The June 2023 event was non-linear and it took more than another year to figure it out. The never-exceed limit on warming, set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 10 years ago, was plus 2 degrees. The only way to hold the heat down in the short term is direct intervention to reflect more sunlight back into space and cool the planet."
