At least 38 people have been reported dead as of June 28, with hundreds injured or missing. Entire villages have been submerged, and critical transportation routes remain blocked. Pakistan's climate minister, Sherry Rehman, publicly slammed what she called 'climate injustice'. Pakistan contributes less than 1% to global greenhouse gas emissions yet ranks among the top countries suffering from climate-related disasters."

As greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, more and more of this energy becomes trapped, resulting in an escalating energy imbalance. The root cause of this discrepancy is a decrease in Earth's solar reflectivity."

It's cooler than normal sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Guinea, which tends to weaken the monsoon and easterly waves over West Africa. It has the power to play a role in suppressing storm development due to its cooling effects, but its impacts are typically more modest and localised. Long-range forecasts continue to show that the Atlantic Niño is likely to fade in the coming weeks, clearing the way for an above-average hurricane season. Colorado State University's latest extended forecast calls for 17 named storms, nine hurricanes and four major hurricanes during the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season (Category 3 or above)."
