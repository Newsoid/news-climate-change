The smoke from these intense fires acts like a giant shield, reflecting sunlight back into space. The increased reflection of sunlight from aerosols, and the resulting cooler summers, leads to thicker Arctic ice lasting into the following winter. This cooling effect has also been shown to alter tropical rainfall patterns. Future research will be crucial to investigate the long-term effects of these fire events and how the changing landscape impacts the climate."
