The carbon budget is a measure of how much CO2 can still be emitted by humanity while keeping the temperature target within reasonable limits. To have a 66% chance of staying below the target, emissions from 2025 onwards must be limited to 80 billion tons of CO2. Prof Joeri Rogelj from Imperial College London stressed the need for significant emissions cuts at the upcoming UN Cop30 climate summit in November."
