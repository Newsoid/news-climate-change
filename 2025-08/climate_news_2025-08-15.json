            "summary": "Scientists have warned that a new weather phenomenon dubbed the 'firewave' has the potential to devastate UK cities. The term describes multiple wildfires erupting in urban areas due to prolonged hot weather. London firefighters had to battle three separate grass fires in 24 hours as temperatures reached 33.3°C (91°F) in the capital. Professor Guillermo Rein found that just 10 days of extremely dry conditions are enough to significantly increase the chances of multiple fires igniting at once. The most important factor for predicting urban wildfires is the amount of water the atmosphere can absorb from the land called the vapour pressure deficit."

This summer, parts of the reef saw mass coral bleaching for the sixth time since 2016. Western Australia has its own World Heritage-listed reef at Ningaloo, famed for its corals and whale sharks. It had been largely untouched by the rising ocean heat that has hit most of the world's reefs. This week, marine scientists from government agencies and universities revealed the most comprehensive assessment yet of the impacts of that heatwave."
