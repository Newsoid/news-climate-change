In its positive or warmer phase, higher than normal sea surface temperatures are found stretching from the western coast of North America down through the Equatorial Pacific. In the negative or cool phase, cooler sea temperatures are prevalent with a warm core through the north-central Pacific. The current PDO is negative."

Unplanned construction, poorly designed rural road networks, illegal encroachments on waterways, and neglected maintenance and desilting of drains have severely disrupted natural rainwater flow. Recharge wells, which replenish the subsurface aquifer, are a promising alternative."
