The system is a result of significant investment and five years of dedicated research and development. The frequency of rapid intensification in Atlantic tropical cyclones has been increasing over the past 30 years. Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida as a Category 4 storm, tragically becoming the deadliest hurricane in the contiguous U.S. as Katrina. Flooding is arguably the most common and costly natural disaster in the United States. NOAA is investing in research to bolster flood resilience nationwide."
