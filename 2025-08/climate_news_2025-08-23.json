Mostert and his co-researchers from the Brain and Mind Institute studied the effects of exposure to climate change on depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts. Their study focused on the coastal Kilifi region of Kenya, which experienced drought, heatwaves and less rain between 2010 and 2022. Women from informal settlements had a 10.8% higher incidence of depressive symptoms compared to their counterparts in more stable rural areas. The study suggests that the cumulative effects of climate change and soaring food prices led to a 48% increase in suicidal thoughts among the rural women."
