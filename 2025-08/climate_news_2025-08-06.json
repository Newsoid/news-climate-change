The reduction in singing is attributed to the disappearance of their main food source, krill, caused by a marine heatwave dubbed 'The Blob'. The Blob was a dense pool of warm water that significantly raised Pacific Ocean temperatures by over 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit. The elevated temperatures fostered toxic algae blooms, which decimated krill populations and other marine life."

Scientists warn that without urgent action, this underwater paradise may be nearing a point of no return. In the far north, coral cover dropped from almost 40% to 30%. In the central section, losses averaged 14%. The south fared even worse, shedding nearly a third of its coral after experiencing highest heat stress ever recorded in the region."
