            "summary": "It has been a record season for wildfires in Saskatchewan. Rocky Mountain glaciers feed the South Saskatchewan River from which the province draws most of its water. Dr. John Pomeroy, director of the Centre for Hydrology at University of Saskatchewan, said the glaciers melt 8 to 9 metres a year. The glaciers absorb a lot of solar energy and melt very, very quickly. Some of the glaciers are seeing algae blooms, which thrive in the nutrients the wildfire soot provides."
