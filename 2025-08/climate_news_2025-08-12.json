The extension comes as a record-breaking marine heatwave has killed corals over a 1,500km stretch of ocean off the WA coast. Woodside is supporting free general admission to the WA Maritime Museum on Sunday 17 August for the 'Woodside Energy Open Day'. The event will feature 'family-friendly activities all about marine science' as part of National Science Week. The Conservation Council of WA is organising a 'requiem for our reefs' at the Maritime Museum to highlight the 'devastating impact of Woodside's emissions on WA's coral reef system'"

Corals have the genes to survive another 250 years of climate change."
