A new study led by CMCC has identified the driving forces behind these events. Subtropical ridges are persistent intrusions of warm air from over the African continent into Europe. When these ridges settle over the Mediterranean basin for five days or more, they cause the prevailing winds to still, which leads the sea to stop shedding heat and surface waters to warm rapidly."

The summer was marked by 20 tropical nights, 15 autumn typhoons, heavy snow and torrential rain in November. This volatile pattern of extreme weather shows that economic damage and social instability are deeply intertwined with national security. Japan's overwhelming reliance on foreign imports for 97 percent of its energy, with 83 percent of that coming from fossil fuels, creates significant geopolitical risks and economic vulnerabilities. Renewable energy is a crucial pathway to enhancing energy self-sufficiency and strengthening national security in Korea."
