Orange County's growth control ordinances are null and void because of a new state law. The law bars counties listed in Federal Disaster Declarations for past hurricanes like Debby, Helene, or Milton from adopting restrictive amendments to their comprehensive plans."

            "summary": "Dissacus forecast, a prehistoric predator, dramatically altered its diet during a period of rapid global warming. The ancient mammal began eating tougher, more brittle foods like bones when its usual prey became scarce. This dietary change coincided with a reduction in the animal's overall size, likely due to dwindling food resources. The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, the period of warming studied, lasted approximately 200,000 years. The study's implications for conservation are clear: species with narrow diets, like pandas, are vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change, while adaptable species, like raccoons and jackals, have a greater chance of survival."

            "summary": "August 5, 2025 is predicted to be one of the shortest days on record. The Earth's rotation on Tuesday is expected to shave off between 1.25 and 1.51 milliseconds from the standard 86,400 seconds it takes for one full spin. This would make August 5 the third time this summer the Earth has recorded a speed-up, following similar occurrences on July 9 and July 22. Scientists don't know the cause of the acceleration. The prevailing theory is that it could be linked to shifts within the Earth's inner core or atmospheric patterns."
