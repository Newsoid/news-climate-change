The storm's core impact was concentrated in Nghe An and Ha Tinh provinces, and it delivered extensive rainfall from the Red River Delta, including Hanoi, down to the Central City of Da Nang. Landslides and flooding have rendered numerous transportation routes impassable. Roads and culverts were submerged, severely hampering transportation and relief efforts. The Ministry of Agriculture and Environment sent an urgent dispatch to the People's Committees of provinces and cities."
