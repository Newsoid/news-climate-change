The smoke blanketed much of north America, causing hazardous air quality conditions and impacting public health. Warmer temperatures,drier conditions, and increased fuel loads create a more favorable environment for wildfires to ignite and spread. The Arctic is warming at a rate two to four times faster than the global average. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and implementing forest management practices are crucial steps."
