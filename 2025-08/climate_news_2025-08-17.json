Malakand is the most responsible with 50% tree cover loss at 1.73 kha compared to an average of 431 ha between 2005 and 2024. KP has been losing forests at a rate of 1.5% annually equivalent to 11,000 hectares per year between 2000 and 2023. Chitral is projected loss under current trends is 23% by 2030. Deforestation is not only about environmental degradation, it is about loss of human life, disruption of livelihoods, displacement of vulnerable communities and destruction of costly infrastructure."
