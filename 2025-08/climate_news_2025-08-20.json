Hurricanes can cause the release of hazardous materials from industrial sites, sewage treatment plants, and agricultural runoff. Storm surges and flooding erode shorelines, impact water quality and habitats, introduce invasive species and lower oxygen levels in marine ecosystems. Climate change intensifies hurricanes by increasing their strength, rainfall, and storm surge. Forecasters forecast 13 to 18 named storms this season."
