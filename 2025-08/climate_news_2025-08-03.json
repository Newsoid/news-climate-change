July is usually Finland's warmest month, with temperatures between 15°C and 20°C, but this summer has seen temperatures up to 10 degrees higher than normal.

Water temperatures in some areas have risen so high that cold-water fish like trout and Arctic grayling are in danger."

Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, wildfires, hurricanes, and volcanic eruptions, also affect the earth's climate. Extraction of natural resources from earth's ore for rare earth materials has become a major competition for global players fueling global warming. The ongoing Russia- Ukraine and Isreal-Palestine wars has contributed more than 230 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions, worsening the climate crisis.
