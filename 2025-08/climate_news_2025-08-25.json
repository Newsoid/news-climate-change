The encroaching ocean has contaminated the groundwater reserves and made Tuvalu reliant on rainfall for fresh water supplies. Once a self-sufficient country, it's now dependent on imports from richer nations. In 2002, the nation threatened to sue Australia for their outsized role in climate change. In 2021, they joined with Antigua and Barbuda to register to a new UN commission on Small Island Island Climate Change."
