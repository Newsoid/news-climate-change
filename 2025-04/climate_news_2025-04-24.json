Global temperatures rose by around 0.07°C due to reduced sulphur emissions, particularly since 2010. Sulphur dioxide converts into sulphate aerosols in the atmosphere, which cool the planet by reflecting sunlight and enhancing cloud formation."

The current bleaching event has exceeded the previous episode from 2014 to 2017, which affected approximately two-thirds of the reefs, and is now the most severe of its kind in history. Last year was the hottest on Earth, with heating of the oceans contributing to the ongoing coral bleach crisis. Coral reefs are home to a quarter of all marine species and support high levels of biodiversity, providing food and protection to one billion people."
