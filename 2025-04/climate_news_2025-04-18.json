PBS's story focuses on the woes of Senegal's fishing industry and non-governmental organizations' (NGO) claims that the world isn't providing promised funds for climate change mitigation. There is no evidence that climate change is worsening fishing conditions or contributing to depleted fish stocks. Illegal fishing by foreign operators is a more viable cause for the woes."
