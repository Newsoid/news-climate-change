            "summary": "Climate change is a ticking time bomb wreaking havoc globally. Since the Industrial Revolution, capitalist expansion has led to a massive upsurge in carbon emissions, rising global temperatures, glacier melt and recurring extreme weather events. Some scholars believe that capitalism can be transformed to address the climate disaster through 'green growth' and 'sustainable development'. Governments and international organisations have introduced policies to promote sustainability within market-driven economies."
