            "summary": "Increasing temperatures due to climate change are leading to earlier and more intense wildfires, posing significant threats to ecosystems, air quality, and public health. Global warming has led to reduced snowpack and earlier snowmelt, causing forests to dry out sooner. Warmer temperatures, combined with stronger winds and lower humidity levels, have contributed to the rapid spread of these fires."
