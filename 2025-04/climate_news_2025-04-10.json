The United Nations' Emissions Gap report for 2024 said the world was likely to warm 3.1 degrees Celsius over the course of this century without efforts to rapidly reduce emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has forecast that without drastic action temperatures will be even higher than that by the end of the century. In the United States alone, climate change is expected to wipe away $1.47 trillion in value from real estate around the country by 2055."

Jennifer Baltzer, Canada research chair in forests and global change, published this first-of-its-kind data. She and her colleagues collected samples at 20 boreal forests of Alaska and the Northwest Territories that had burned in 2009 or 2014. They found that the fires were less destructive than initially thought. They also found that there was a change in the types of trees that were growing back following the fires."
