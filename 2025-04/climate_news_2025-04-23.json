Tipping points mentioned in the study include collapse of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, coral reef die-offs, Amazon rainforest loss, lack of winter sea ice in the Arctic, abrupt permafrost thaw, mountain glacier loss and collapse of a key Atlantic current."

When the Sun is shining, it doesn't heat the air in the lowest few kilometres of the atmosphere (the troposphere). The Sun's rays heat Earth, not the air. The air is then warmed from below, from the ground. If there is lots of moisture available, we get thunderstorm clouds"
