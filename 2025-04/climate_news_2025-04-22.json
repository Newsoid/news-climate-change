In April, temperatures in Lahore usually range between 30 and 37 degrees Celsius, but the past few years have seen a noticeable increase in average temperatures. Rapid urbanization and an increased population growth are key factors behind Lahore's increasing temperatures. Between 1990 and 2020, the city converted a significant portion of its green spaces into concrete structures, roads, and buildings. It lost 70 per cent of its tree cover between 2010 and 2017."
