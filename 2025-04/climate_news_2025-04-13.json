Global CO₂ equivalent emissions reached 54.6 billion tons in 2024, up nearly 1% from the previous year, intensifying global warming. If global average temperatures rise to 2.7°C by century's end, the planet will face more intense extreme weather, ecosystem collapse and significant economic losses. Without robust mitigation, the global economy could shrink by 20% annually from 2049, equating to $38 trillion in losses."
