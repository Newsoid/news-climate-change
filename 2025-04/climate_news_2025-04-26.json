Moscow, for example, saw a reduction in cold related deaths 11.5 times greater than those associated with heat. The authors suggest that cities must take a seasonal approach to mitigating the urban heat island effect."

The proposed cuts would close the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Sciences and the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory and cut funding to the office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research by nearly 75%. The budget for the National Marine Fisheries Service would be cut roughly 30%, from $1.1 billion to $789.3 million. Environmentalists on the Chesapeake Bay are worried about how cuts could affect its ecosystem and restoration. The American Meteorological Society warns that the upcoming cuts will negatively impact forecasters' ability to issue alerts and warnings for severe storms."

The timing of the tides during storm landfall meant little to no flooding impacts. Climate change is driving more extreme rainfall and generate more intense flooding."
