The Pacific flyway is the route used by migrating species including western sandpipers, red-necked grebe, dunlin, and brant. Central and Mississippi flyways are used by species such as the sandhill crane, lesser scaup, and prairie birds. Atlantic flyway used by orioles, sparrows, and other songbirds. Permanent residents do not migrate."
