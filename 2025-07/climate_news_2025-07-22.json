Iceland's parliament should codify an obligation to protect citizens from unadaptable climate risk. Scientists have long warned of accelerating climate change. We have already breached the critical threshold of 1.5°C warming, far ahead of schedule. Tipping points occur when critical parts of the Earth's climate system cross thresholds."

The Industrial Revolution was brought about by the creation of steam-powered engines. Many of these advancements were powered by coal, a fossil fuel. As humans used machinery powered by fossil fuels and carried out agricultural and industrial processes, they released greenhouse gases. The most harmful ones, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane and nitrous oxide, trap heat in Earth's atmosphere."
