President Trump's proposed 2026 budget would put an end to the observatory along with three other key observatories and almost all the climate research being done by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The readings collected from Mauna loa were used to create what is famously known as the Keeling curve."

The prime minister can convene a joint meeting of the six councils, along with the planning and other commissions to craft a shared vision."
