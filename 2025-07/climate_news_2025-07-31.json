A new study by Duijndam et al. offers the first global, data-driven insight into the complex web of factors that dictate why and how people decide to leave their coastal homes. In low-income nations, the economic necessity often compels vulnerable coastal populations to remain in place despite increasing risks. In wealthier countries with robust infrastructure and social welfare systems, migration is driven by risk perception."
