The federal government is targeting a 43 per cent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030. A more challenging target between 65 and 75 per cent is being considered by the Climate Change Authority, which will advise the government. Chris Bowen says Australia is on schedule to reach its climate emissions targets. Opposition backbenchers are challenging the Coalition's support for a net-zero emissions target."
