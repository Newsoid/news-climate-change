            "summary": "According to NIWA data, New Zealand's cities are getting hotter. Auckland could face nearly 50 extra hot days each year by the end of the century. The rise in temperature is partly due to the urban heat island effect, where roads, buildings, and concrete trap heat. Timothy Welch, Senior Lecturer in Urban Planning from the University of Auckland, talks to Kathryn about some of the changes he says could be made quickly."

He argues that the current mental health framework is ill-equipped to identify or treat climate anxiety as a distinct condition. He calls for destigmatization and the development of dedicated support services that validate lived experiences and provide practical coping mechanisms."

The lack of transparency in sourcing ingredients, the treatment of animals, and the practices of suppliers have raised ethical questions. The low wages and limited benefits for McDonald's employees are also a major point of contention."
