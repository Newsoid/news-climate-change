Male participation in agriculture declined between 2000 and 2016 and female participation also fell."

            "summary": "Shrinking Antarctic sea ice is making humpback whales migrate south three weeks earlier than 21 years ago. Less available krill prior to the migration could be forcing the whales back to the feeding grounds earlier, according to a study by Australia's University of Queensland. "

In 2023, Canada's worst-ever fire season, 42.9 million acres of land were scorched, an extraordinary scale of damage that focused attention on the growing threat of wildfires boosted by human-induced climate change."

            "summary": "The fossil fuel industry pumped 389m tonnes of carbon pollution into the atmosphere last year by needlessly flaring gas, according to a World Bank report. Global gas flaring rose for the second year in a row to reach its highest level since 2007. Russia, Iran, Iraq, the US, Venezuela, Algeria, Libya, Mexico and Nigeria were responsible for three-quarters of all gas flared in 2024. Most of the worst offenders were countries with state-owned oil companies."
