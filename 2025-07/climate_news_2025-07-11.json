A typical Earth day lasts about 86,400 seconds. The moon's distance from Earth's equator can accelerate the planet's rotation."

The activists are convinced of their own righteousness, so certain that their cause is only just but existential, that they openly call for bypassing democratic processes. The real work of 'climate action' consists mostly of lawsuits, street theater, and the invention of new bureaucratic job titles."
