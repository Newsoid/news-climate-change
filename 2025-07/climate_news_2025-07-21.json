If greenhouse gas emissions continue on a pessimistic trajectory, the effect of climate change on Earth's rotational behavior could surpass the influence of the moon by the end of the century. This could have a negative impact on high-frequency trading and financial market stability."

            "summary": "The 'big, beautiful bill' is expected to make a major dent in the U.S.'s climate progress, adding significantly more planet-warming emissions to the atmosphere. Models of the legislation that have emerged since its passage earlier this month show that the bill's implementation will increase emissions by 8%."

The loss and introduction of animals over 10 kg have radically changed local ecosystems, prompting new conservation concerns. The bias for introducing mammals and evolutionary isolation could partially explain why native mammals have been so strongly affected."
