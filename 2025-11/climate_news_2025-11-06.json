Poor communities are more vulnerable to hazards like extreme heat and supersized storms and less likely to have the resources to cope with them than wealthier places. People in poverty are also more likely to suffer when poverty and climate change collide. Even in highly developed countries, 82 per cent of people living in poverty will be exposed to at least one of four climate hazards."
