Severe drought and increased evaporation due to shifting weather patterns have accelerated the retreat of its shoreline. The water receded 500 meters from the historical shoreline, revealing structures that have remained submerged for decades. The exposed wooden pier, believed to be over 100 years old, was once a vital transportation point for local residents."
