            "summary": "Pakistan submitted NDC 3.0 to UNFCCC. It aims for a 50% reduction in projected greenhouse gas emissions, with 17% through domestic efforts and 33% dependent on international support. The NDC projects a $565.7 billion cost through 2025, with around two-thirds of that cost dependent on foreign grants and external loans. Agriculture accounts for about 24% of GDP, employs nearly half of the workforce and drives foreign exchange earnings, but it's becoming more vulnerable to climate-related risks."

            "summary": "Changes in recommendations from the Pacific Flyway Council prompted an increase in the northern pintail duck bag limit from one to three and a reduction in the goose bag limit by one. It's meant to address a declining trend population estimates for some goose species. Chris Bonsignore, a retired biologist and avid waterfowl hunter, found the change unusual. It reflects a change in how biologists think about conserving the species."

            "summary": "Melissa was the second-strongest Atlantic storm ever recorded. It devastated New Orleans and killed almost 1,400 people and left thousands homeless and stranded in the birthplace of jazz, Jamaica. The poverty rate in Jamaica has been reduced to the lowest on record 8.2 per cent in 2023, but the situation facing Jamaicans is always subject to climate events such as Melissa. Foreign debt payments make up more than a 20 per cent of the Jamaican government's revenue."

Montha cyclone devastated large tracts of prawn farms, especially in Prakasam district and parts of West Godavari. Nearly 1,000 acres of ponds were affected by floods, and several others remain submerged. Floodwaters diluted salinity levels, hampering prawn growth. Longer cloudy weather and temperature drops have stressed prawns, reducing feeding activity."
