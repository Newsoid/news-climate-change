Over 120,000 structures suffered roof damage, leaving an estimated 140,000 Jamaicans without access to essential aid. The immediate impact of Melissa is staggering. The scale of destruction signals a rapidly escalating trend of extreme weather events. Climate change is driving increased internal displacement. Developed nations have a moral and economic imperative to support adaptation efforts in vulnerable countries like Jamaica."
