Aerosols originating from human activities, especially those tied to fossil fuel combustion, have historically increased cloud reflectivity by producing smaller droplets. The reduction in air pollution driven by decades of environmental regulation has had the unintended consequence of diminishing aerosol concentrations. This decreases the number of condensation nuclei, leading to fewer droplets within clouds."
