Honduras has presented a second update of its nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30) on climate change. The NDC outlines the country's climate action plan, including its target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It's an action provided for in the Paris Agreement, in which nations commit to curbing global warming through promises to reduce emissions, restore forests, and advance towards resilient development. Experts warn that the ambitious targets Honduras presents in its NDC do not seem realistic."

African negotiators, civil society organisations, and climate experts want the Loss and Damage agenda to move from symbolic pledges to actual funding reaching affected communities on the ground. The AGN is pushing for predictable, grant-based finance, not loans that increase debt burdens on already struggling economies. The Africa Group insists the Fund must be fully operational, fairly governed, and deliver timely support to vulnerable countries. The Pan African Climate Justice Alliance wants COP30 to adopt a justice-centred approach."
