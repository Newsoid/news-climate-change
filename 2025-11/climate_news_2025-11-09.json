Earth's warming climate has gotten nastier faster than society has been able to wean itself from burning the coal, oil and natural gas that emits carbon pollution. The planet's annual temperature jumped about 0.46 degrees Celsius (0.83 degrees Fahrenheit) since 2015. This year will be either the second or third hottest on record. America has been hit by 193 disasters that cost at least $1 billion in the past 10 years for a total bill of $5 trillion."
