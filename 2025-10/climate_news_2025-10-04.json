In Gabiley Region of Somaliland, farmers face the dual burden of enduring climate shifts and striving for sustainable agricultural practices. Traditional knowledge, socio-economic status, access to education, and proximity to markets are instrumental in determining the range and effectiveness of adaptation strategies. The study argues for the importance of leveraging technology as part of a collective strategy to bolster agricultural resilience within the community."

This year, there's been a quiet Atlantic hurricane season. It's only the second time since 1950 that there were no named storms during the peak of the hurricane season since modern record-keeping began. The Weather Channel's meteorologists are focusing on a tropical wave coming off the coast of Africa, which could become a hurricane near the Lesser Antilles next week."
