The report is being released ahead of COP30 – the UN's annual climate summit taking place this November in Belém, Brazil. Global warming is already about 1.4°C (2.52°F) above pre-industrial levels. Coral reefs are crossing their heat threshold of around 1.2°C or 1.8-2.7°F. Even if warming is limited to 1.5°C, there is an over 99 percent chance that warm-water reefs will pass this point of no return."
