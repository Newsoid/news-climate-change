Shifting rainfall patterns are reducing crop yields, and by 2050, Uganda could lose up to one-third of all food crop production. The losses mean increased hunger, reduced household income, and rising unemployment. Youth, who make up 78 percent of Uganda's population, face vanishing opportunities in farming and related sectors. The Green Jobs Programme is supporting the informal sector through apprenticeships and industrial hubs."
