The cyclone is expected to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm by October 28 and affect several states along India's eastern and southern coasts. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and rescue and relief teams from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Indian Coast Guard have been placed on standby for immediate deployment. Fishermen have been advised not to venture into the Bay until October 29."

Archaeological and paleoecological data reveal widespread instances of forest clearing and burning, sometimes occurring tens of thousands of years ago. The impact of these early human activities was considerable. It suggests that humans were not merely passive inhabitants of the landscape, but active agents of environmental change."
