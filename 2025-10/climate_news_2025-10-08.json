Last year global temperatures hit new heights, with the average temporarily exceeding 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Heatwaves have increased in frequency, are more severe and last longer, breaking records for hottest days and warmest months here in the UK. The Atlantic hurricane season produced multiple major hurricanes with extreme wind speeds and record rainfall causing floods in the Caribbean and American coastal states. US President Donald Trump has dismissed climate change as 'the greatest con job' or 'deception' ever inflicted on the world."
