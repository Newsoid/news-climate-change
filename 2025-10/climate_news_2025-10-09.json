Kiribati community leader Charles Kiata said life on the island is becoming extremely hard as sea levels rise and the region is hit by more severe storms, higher temperatures and drought. Amnesty International is also asking the government to stop deporting overstayers from the Pacific, who would be returning to harsh conditions."

This stifled evaporation and subsequent atmospheric moisture recycling, leaving Mexican soils critically desiccated and triggering a cascade of dry air masses moving northward into the American Southwest."

People living close to fracking sites have a double incidence of childhood leukaemia and the elderly are suffering from increased rates of dementia. Fossil fuels are directly and explicitly subsidised to the tune of $1.3 trillion by governments and indirectly supported by $5.7 trillion."
