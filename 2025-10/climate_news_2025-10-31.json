The relationship between global averages and local extremes is nonlinear and even small changes in global averages create much larger local shocks. Extreme heat touches everyone, but its impacts are unequal. For wealthy people, it's a threat to survival, for poorer ones, it means rising costs of cooling and infrastructure repair."
