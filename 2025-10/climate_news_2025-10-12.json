The 2025 Global Hunger Index reports that 36.8 percent of people in Kenya are undernourished. This is a sharp increase from 22.2 percent in 2016 and raises concerns about the country's progress toward food security. The report attributes this setback to prolonged droughts, high food prices, and declining household purchasing power. Arid and semi-arid areas account for almost 70 percent of those facing food insecurity. Conflict and instability in neighbouring countries have worsened food security in Kenya."
