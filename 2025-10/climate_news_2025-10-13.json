The last two years were earth's warmest on record, with marine heatwaves that stressed 84% of the world's coral reefs to the point of bleaching and, in some cases, death. For corals to recover, the world would need to drastically ramp up climate action to reverse temperatures back down to one degree above the pre-industrial average."
