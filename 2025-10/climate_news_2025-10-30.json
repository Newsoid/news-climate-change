According to the memo, attention should be directed toward poverty and hunger, which he described as the biggest challenges humanity has always faced. The United Nations said this week that humanity has failed to achieve its target of limiting global heating to 1.5°C."

Developing countries will need over $310 billion a year by 2035 to protect people and infrastructure from rising temperatures, floods, and droughts. International funding for adaptation stood at just $26 billion in 2023, a seven per cent decline from the previous year. UNEP warns that unless funding increases sharply, the Glasgow Climate Pact goal of doubling international adaptation finance to $40 billion by 2025 will not be achieved."
