Wildfires are becoming more frequent and impactful in the ABZ. Nearly half of the carbon stored in soil on the planet is thought to be in this region."

            "summary": "The value of agricultural output in the Philippines may have declined by more than 1% in 2024. El Niño and La Niña adversely affected the sector. The El Niño weather event brought below-normal rainfall conditions, dry spells and droughts that affected the overall harvest during the year. The second half of the year, the Philippines experienced a series of storms that brought heavy rains and caused flooding. African Swine Fever (ASF) and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza or bird flu continue to affect the production in livestock and poultry sectors."
