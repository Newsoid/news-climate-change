The UN Secretary-General António Guterres has warned that such a withdrawal could lead to a 'crippled' Paris Agreement. Without US participation, other nations may feel less compelled to meet their own commitments, leading to an increase in global emissions. In Africa alone, crop yields could decrease by as much as 50 percent by 2020 due to climate impacts."

The water level and state are always on the table at summits and meetings of the Framework Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment (Tehran Convention) signed by Republic of Azerbaijan, Islamic Republic of Iran, Republic of Kazakhstan, Russian Federation, and Turkmenistan. Baku hosted the side event discussing the water decline in light of climate change at COP29 under Azerbaijan's chairmanship on November 18 last year. Kazakhstan is to create a five-sided working group of experts to study changes in the water level of the Sea."

For Pakistan, the Paris Agreement symbolised more than a global pact; it was a lifeline. Pakistan bears a disproportionate share of climate impacts, from glacial melts threatening water security to catastrophic floods submerging entire regions. Pakistan's sprawling rural areas and growing urban populations represent vast opportunities to pioneer sustainable solutions. Investments in energy efficiency, smart grids, and green infrastructure can transform Pakistan into a model of climate resilience for the Global South. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) emerges as a key instrument in this endeavour."
