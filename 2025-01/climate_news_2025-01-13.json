The message referred to reports that 2024 was the hottest year on record and the first to breach a key global warming threshold of 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures. Ms Bligh, a former chief executive of Reading council, said: 'Darwin once said, 'It is not the strongest of the species, nor the most intelligent that survives'. It is the one that is adaptable to change, that lives within the means available and works cooperatively against common threats.'"
