The Nundus are among the latest arrivals in the Community Refugee Integration and Settlement Pilot (CRISP), which is in its third year. CRISP connects locals with refugee families to help them adjust to their new life. It is hoped the model will help the families become self-reliant, active community members."

The Babuyan Claro volcano in the Philippines was once thought to be a candidate, but a new study by the University of St. Andrews in Scotland points to a more remote eruption that took place on the Kuril Islands north of Hokkaido, Japan. The study focused on ice cores from Greenland."

The study highlights a strong topographic dependence in the frequency of compound LSLW extremes, with a national average frequency of 16.4 days per year. Renewable energy supply in eastern China is particularly affected, with power output dropping by 80% compared to average climate conditions. Under future climate scenarios, the frequency increases nationwide across all scenarios, with Tibetan Plateau and northwestern China facing significant frequency increases. The inter-grid electricity transmission can significantly reduce the potential impacts caused by compound L SLW extremes"
