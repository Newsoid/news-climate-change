In the year 536 CE, a series of volcanic eruptions in the Northern Hemisphere unleashed ash and sulfur gases into the atmosphere, enshrouding the globe in a veil that blocked sunlight. This phenomenon led to global cooling, devastating agriculture and populations across the world. This period is often recognized as one of the worst in human history due to the prolonged 'volcanic winter' that ensued. Researchers analyzed the annual rings in over 100 pieces of 6th-century Danish oak and found that the summers between"
