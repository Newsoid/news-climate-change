            "summary": "The ongoing volcanic activity in the Afar region of Ethiopia is said to be a precursor of more to come. Volcanic activity may create a sea barrier between Ethiopia and Somalia. The Afar people live in the Danakil Depression, which is already below sea level and may be submerged by floods from the Red sea. Ethiopia wants to take over Somali lands. There is a need for a new social contract in the Horn of Africa."

According to the commission, Marin County is facing about $17 billion in expenses to build adaptation projects, such as living shorelines, marshes and potentially seawalls and levees to protect itself from inundation. It will cost $110 billion to protect themselves from the effects of sea-level rise through 2050."
