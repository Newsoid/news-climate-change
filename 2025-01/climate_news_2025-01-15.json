Experts warn that the unfolding destruction of the LA fires could be replicated in Australia. Governments in the US and California have created the conditions for the fires to spread by slashing tens of millions of dollars from firefighting capabilities and the lack of infrastructure to deal with disasters. Australia's national fleet for aerial firefighting includes about 170 aircraft."

Anderson was a witness for the state in Montana's youth climate trial. He got his math wrong several times, confused Montana's emissions with that of the entire Mountain West region, used 2022 greenhouse gas emissions data, even though data had only been released through 2020. He used old data to make people think things haven't changed much in the last 10 years. His biggest mistake is the idea that we must choose between a healthy environment and a healthy economy. Montana has the seventh-largest wind potential in the country. We can lower pollution and grow energy jobs."
