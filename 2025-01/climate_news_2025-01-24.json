            "summary": "Pakistan is facing a multitude of climate-related challenges. Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and more severe. The 2022 deluge submerged a third of the country, displaced 33 million people and caused damages exceeding $30 billion. The 2010 super floods were similarly catastrophic, affecting over 20 million people. The retreat of glaciers in the northern regions highlights the crisis. Pakistan houses more than 7,200 glaciers, but they are melting at an unprecedented rate. The economic toll of climate disasters is staggering, with losses amounting to $3.8 billion annually. Pakistan has made strides in renewable energy, with solar and wind projects contributing nearly 5% of its energy mix by 2021."

It's stored between 1,460 and 1,600 billion metric tons of organic carbon. It also releases significant amounts of CO2 and methane. Thawing permafrost changes the Arctic landscape and changes water systems. Mitigation focuses on reducing greenhouse gases to decelerate global warming. Adaptation requires innovative infrastructure design, continuous monitoring and use of eco-friendly land practices."
