Global warming has made 77% of the Earth's land drier over the past three decades and increased the proportion of excessively salty soils. Drylands, or arid areas where water is hard to come by, now make up more than 40% of planet (except Antarctica), a likely permanent consequence of climate change. 10% of world's soils are affected by excess salt, with another 2.5 billion acres at risk."

            "summary": "Four million common murres died in Alaska during a two-year marine heat wave that started in 2014. Scientists say it was the largest single species die-off in modern history and linked it to human-caused climate change. The annual Christmas Bird Count saw a dramatic decline in these seabirds when the catastrophic heat wave began affecting the North Pacific Ocean. Suzi Golodoff has studied Unalaska's birds for nearly 50 years."
