The previous record of 20.98 degrees Celsius was set in August 2023. The Atlantic basin has experienced substantial heat amplification since 2016. In August 2024, Arctic Ocean's mean sea surface temperatures were between 2 and 4 degrees Celsius warmer than usual. September 2024 was the second-warmest month on record. Extreme heat in the oceans devastates coral reefs, which thrive in a narrow range of temperatures between 23 and 29 degrees Celsius."
