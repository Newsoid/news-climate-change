Most human deaths occurred during the preceding heatwave. In the first fortnight of 1939, Adelaide endured 13 days of temperatures exceeding 34°C. Noel Weller, who lived on a suburban block in Glandore with his wife and two children, kept a daily diary. Irene Ingram lived in the closely-packed row cottages of Adelaide's East End in the 1930s with her husband and son and they used to sleep outdoors to escape the heat."
