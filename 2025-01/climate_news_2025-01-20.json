There are over 100 volcanoes beneath the Antarctic ice, located along an active volcanic rift system known as West Antarctic Rift System. Volcanic eruptions release additional heat, lava, and ash, which warm the ice sheet, potentially melting millions of cubic meters of ice annually. This accelerated melting could contribute to global sea level rise, threatening coastal communities worldwide."
