            "summary": "The world's largest herring population has migrated up to 800 miles every year from wintering areas in northern Norway to spawning grounds along the country's southwest coast. In 2021, instead of heading south, the adult fish migrated a few hundred miles to Lofoten and they've stuck there ever since. The shift is worrying. Fewer baby herring might survive in the colder and less plankton-rich conditions in the north, something that could cause population declines in the long term. The collapse of migration patterns may also have ripple effects on the fish, birds, and mammals along the coast that prey on the herring larvae."
