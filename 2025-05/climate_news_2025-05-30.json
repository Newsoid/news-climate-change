            "summary": "Blair wrote a foreword to a report on climate change for his think-tank. He said Labour's plan to phase out fossil fuels was 'doomed to fail' and urged ministers to rethink the Government's 'irrational' approach. Mr Miliband is in charge of Labour's mission to decarbonise the UK's entire electricity supply by 2030. On Friday he said critics of his agenda were being 'far too defeatist about Britain'."
