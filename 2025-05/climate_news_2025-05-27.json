According to Cadre Harmonisé food security report, nearly 31 million Nigerians are expected to face acute food and nutrition insecurity during the June-August lean season. The causes of Nigeria's food crisis are multiple and deeply interwoven. Nigeria is facing severe desertification in the North, coastal erosion and flooding in the South and irregular rainfall patterns. Economic reforms under the Bola Tinubu administration have added further strain to vulnerable households. The government needs to prioritise smallholder farmers and improve access to credit, inputs, and land."

By 2050, climate-intensified natural disasters could lead to $12.5 trillion in global economic losses. Corporate exposure to climate risks is expected to triple by mid-century, with over $1.14 trillion in market value at risk for companies listed on major global exchanges. Global revenues from climate adaptation solutions are expected to grow from $1 trillion today to $4 trillion by 2050, while the investment opportunity could soar from $2 trillion to $9 trillion.

The global average has risen to nearly 50 days of extreme heat per year. The extra heat increases the duration of heat waves in tropical regions where it's already warm. Warm water at the surface fuels more intense hurricanes. Heat waves can bleach coral reefs and kill kelp forests."
