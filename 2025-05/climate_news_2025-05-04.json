Evanston's lakefront, the North Shore Channel and the Chicago River are important parts of the Mississippi Flyway. The City of Evanston works with volunteers to create natural areas attractive and safe for migrating birds. Mayor Daniel Biss read a proclamation at the April 28 City Council Meeting."

Most adaptation measures take place at the local level and are specific to their geographic, environmental, and socioeconomic context. The process of developing National Adaptation Plans is led by national governments. Multilateral decisions on climate finance and adaptation estimate adaptation finance needs 'at USD 215-387 billion annually for up until 2030'. Sri Lanka's first Biennial Transparency Report highlights several barriers that hinder the implementation of adaptation measures."
