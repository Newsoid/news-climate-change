The sea level has risen by 3.4mm per year since 1993. There is scientific proof that the rise in CO2 levels is due to the burning of fossil fuels. The world target of net zero emissions by 2050 is unlikely to be achieved with current technology as there are many highly populated nations with low emissions."
