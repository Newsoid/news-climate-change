This is one of the lowest levels of belief in Europe, placing Northern Ireland just above Slovakia and Lithuania – and below the UK average of 90% and 88% in Ireland. However, public concern remains high, with eight out of 10 respondents viewing climate change as a serious threat to human civilisation. The majority of respondents support stronger international cooperation and political action to address it."

The early rains will be beneficial for farmers, especially in drought-prone regions such as Maharashtra, as they will allow quicker sowing of kharif crops such as paddy, maize, and pulses. An early monsoon reduces dependence on irrigation, and replenishes groundwater tables. If farmers have prepared for sowing, the early rains could lead to a longer growing season and potentially better yields, but if farmers are not yet prepared, it could work against them. Rising ocean temperatures are changing the timing, intensity, and spatial distribution of monsoon rains."

The heat is a growing public health emergency that threatens the lives and well-being of millions, especially the poor and vulnerable. People living in small homes with tin roofs, with limited or no access to electricity, clean drinking water, or cooling systems are at risk. The elderly are at a high risk of strokes, as the heat concentrates the blood and puts additional stress on the cardiovascular system. There is a rise in kidney stone formation during hot weather."
