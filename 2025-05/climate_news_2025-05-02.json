            "summary": "Climate change is one of the most pressing threats to global stability. Many people are unable to move away from climate-impacted regions due to socioeconomic, legal, or infrastructural barriers. This phenomenon is called \"involuntary immobility\". The authors of the study argue that ignoring this phenomenon risks amplifying humanitarian disasters that are avoidable with timely, targeted policies."

            "summary": "According to scientists, climate change is mainly caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and the release of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. Agriculture occupies 32% of the world's land area and is used for cultivating crops, raising livestock and growing plants and trees. Women are responsible for 60-80% of food production in rural regions of Asia, Africa and Latin America. They are disproportionately affected by heatwaves in summer and heavy rains in winter, due to the responsibilities placed upon them. Historically, women have been more vulnerable to climate-related disasters than men."
