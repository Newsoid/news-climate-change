            "summary": "A new study uses a novel framework to assess compound flood risks along the Western Mediterranean coast. It highlights hotspots where meteorological and marine factors converge to amplify flooding threats. The Andalusian region is the most extensive risk zone, with nearly half of its analyzed Areas with Potential Storm Flood Risk (APSFRs) scoring high or very high on the Compound Flooding Potential Index (CFPI). Central Valencia, a densely populated and economically vital region, represents a critical hotspot. Northern Catalonia is a smaller, but significant, hotspot where isolated APSFRs exhibit elevated CFPI values."

This is the first significant ice growth in decades, challenging the prevailing narrative of relentless ice loss and highlighting the complex interplay of natural variability and climate dynamics. Four critical glacier basins in East Antarctica reversed their mass loss trends. The study points to anomalous precipitation as the primary driver."
