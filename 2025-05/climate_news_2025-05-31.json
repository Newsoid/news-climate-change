When air is warmed, it rises, but there are many other factors influencing air temperature. Earth mostly sends energy back to space in the form of heat or infrared radiation. Different parts of the rising air have different amounts of energy, giving the air different buoyancy. The moistest, most buoyant air rises the highest, while drier, less buoyant, less warm air doesn't make it so far up."
