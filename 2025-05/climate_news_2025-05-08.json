The research team from the University of Leeds used satellite data to measure the speed of ice streams in West Antarctica. Six of the seven ice streams had been significantly sped up. The fastest-growing ice stream was Kohler West's neighbor, Kohler East. Many Antarctic glaciers are responding to climate change by flowing faster into the ocean. Accelerating ice sheet speed will likely lead to accelerating sea level rise."

Arctic fjords have long been critical carbon sinks, helping to remove planet-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through a process driven by phytoplankton. However, as sea ice continues to melt and glaciers retreat, Arctic waters are becoming warmer and more stratified. This prevents nutrients from rising to the surface, which may ultimately reduce the effectiveness of carbon capture. The future of Arctic ecosystems will depend heavily on how well they adapt to a warmer climate. If they lose their capacity to absorb carbon, more of that pollution remains in the atmosphere, accelerating warming everywhere."
