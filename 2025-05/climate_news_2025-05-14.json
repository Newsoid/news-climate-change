It is making people more exposed to illnesses, exacerbated by increased pollution, flooding, extreme heat, drought and famine. It also increases the spread of infectious diseases like malaria. The WHO has described it as 'the single biggest health threat facing humanity'. 3.6 billion people live in areas susceptible to climate change. The transport sector, followed by electricity and heat producers, are the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions impacts on the health of people. Northern Ghana is experiencing climate change impact on health, leading to high risks of heat-related illnesses, including Cerebrospinal Meningitis (CSM)."
