The scale of threat to life on Earth is devastating. The centrality of fossil fuel production to capitalist accumulation necessitates fundamental economic transformation.

The year 2024 was the hottest year on record and the first with a global average temperature of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The past decade (2015-2024) was the 10 warmest years on record. Skea says the IPCC's target of a 43 per cent emission reduction by 2030 from 2019 levels is outdated."
