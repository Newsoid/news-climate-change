It explains the way the prospect of mild global warming has been beaten up to become 'the greatest moral challenge of our times' by a recent Prime Minister of Australia. It provides historical perspective because he was involved in climate science from the beginning of interest in warming, up to and beyond the point where it became politicised. He explains how the scientific committees of the IPCC became subservient to the political committee."

Less common are glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) and landslide-dammed lake outburst flooding (LLOF)."
