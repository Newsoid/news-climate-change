The northern plains and Pacific Northwest could see a significant rise in average temperatures. Precipitation patterns are expected to shift, leading to more intense droughts in some regions and sporadic heavy rains in others. Changes in the landscape, water shortages, and the increased cost of energy are prompting local communities to rethink water rights and invest in more resilient infrastructure. The tourism sector, concentrated in regions that may become hotter and drier, is at risk."
