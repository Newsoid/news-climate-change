They traced its evolution from the enzyme of the most ancient thermophilic common ancestor to the mesophilic bacterium Escherichia coli using the ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) technique. They found a dramatic increase in catalytic activity at 25 Â°C between the fifth and sixth generations of the enzyme."
