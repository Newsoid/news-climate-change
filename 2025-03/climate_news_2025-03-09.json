Michael Mann, a professor of earth and environmental science at the University of Pennsylvania, was a co-author of the paper which carried the original 'hockey stick' graph. Mann sued Rand Simberg and Mark Steyn for defamation in 2012. Simberg was found guilty and was awarded $1 million from punitive damages."
