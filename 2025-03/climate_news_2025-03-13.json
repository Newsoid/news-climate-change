            "summary": "According to the latest climate reports, the Earth's average temperature has risen by 1.2°C since pre-industrial times. 2020 will be one of the hottest years on record. Rising temperatures lead to melting polar ice caps, which in turn contribute to rising sea levels. Higher temperatures exacerbate the evaporation of freshwater resources, making water scarcer in regions that depend on it for drinking, agriculture and industry. Natural disasters are intensifying in abundance and severity. Access to water is directly linked to climate health. Without it, humanity cannot survive."
