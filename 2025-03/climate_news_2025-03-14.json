Most climate models struggle to accurately simulate the movement of Antarctic ice due to sparse data and the complexity of interactions between the ocean, atmosphere, and frozen surface. Stanford University used machine learning to analyze high-resolution remote-sensing data of ice movements in Antarctica for the first time. Their work reveals some of the fundamental physics governing the large-scale movements of the Antarctic ice sheet and could help improve predictions about how the continent will change in the future."
