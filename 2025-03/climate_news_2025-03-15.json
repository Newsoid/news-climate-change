The richest 10% are responsible for 46% of the growth in emissions between 1990 and 2015 and will use up the remaining carbon budget by 2030. There is also an unequal access to common goods such as water and land. The IPCC has warned that extreme weather events will become more frequent and intense."

            "summary": "Climate change is a global crisis that disproportionately impacts developing countries, such as Nigeria. Less than a year ago, Benue, Borno, and Jigawa states suffered significant flooding, worsened by climate change, which claimed lives and destroyed properties. The state, hindered by inadequate financial resources and a reduction in productive output caused by the disaster, struggles to afford the capital needed to develop the infrastructure required to prevent future occurrences. Domestic financing is the cornerstone of sustainable climate action. It reduces dependency on volatile external funding and fosters local ownership of climate initiatives."
