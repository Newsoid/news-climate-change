Donald Trump seems to recognize climate change only as a minor problem to be managed or an opportunity to exploit. Today, the U.S. is underprepared to defend the homeland in the Arctic or benefit competitively from increased economic development in the region. Russia has significant military and infrastructure across the region, while the United States has already built a significant head start with its liquefied natural gas and oil extraction projects."

This region is home to over 7,000 glaciers, earning it the title of the 'Third Pole'. These glaciers are increasingly susceptible to multiple extreme climatic events, including flash floods and Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs). Almost 30 GLOF-prone sites were identified by UNDP. GB was also impacted severely by flash floods two years ago."
