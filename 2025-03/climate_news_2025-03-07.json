Sequestration rates peaked in 2008 and have been decreasing at a rate of 0.25% per year since then. This decline weakens the planet's ability to offset emissions naturally, making climate change progress more rapidly than previously estimated. The study emphasises the urgent need to restore biodiversity and ecosystem health to counteract this trend."
