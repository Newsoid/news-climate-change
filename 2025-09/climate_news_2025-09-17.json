Climate change is a 'threat multiplier' that places naval bases, ships and operations at risk, reduces operational days at sea and strains already stretched budgets. Extreme weather can delay deployments and limit patrol coverage in contested waters."

The current system of social, economic and political structures that cities are based on is built on a market-led capitalist model and globalisation. This model has caused cities to grow in ways that make economically and socially disadvantaged and underserved people more vulnerable to climate hazards. Transformative adaptation is about pushing for bold, wide-ranging changes that tackle the root causes of vulnerability."
