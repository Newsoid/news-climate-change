Children whose homes were damaged or destroyed often found themselves living with relatives, in temporary housing, or even in shelters. Schools became emergency shelters or supply distribution centers, delaying the start of classes. Some children experience heightened fear whenever heavy rain falls, associating storms with danger, while others struggle with sleep disruptions, flashbacks, or difficulty concentrating in school."
