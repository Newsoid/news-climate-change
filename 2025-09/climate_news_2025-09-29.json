According to the Kerala State Action Plan on Climate Change (KSAPCC), average temperatures could see a 1°C-2°C rise by 2050, under moderate to heavy emissions. Kerala's migrant workers are among the most affected by climate change. About 35 lakh migrant workers contribute about ₹32,000 crore annually to local income through labour, rent, food, and other expenses. Migrant housing is often cramped, poorly ventilated, and dilapidated, designed for profit rather than liveability."
