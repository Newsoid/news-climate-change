            "summary": "As Australia announces a historic defence pact with Papua New Guinea, it's clear that Australia sees the Pacific as a battlefield for control and influence. Few Pacific Island countries (PICs) like having to deal with political pressure from Beijing, and each has to navigate the tension between remaining friendly with Taiwan and accepting Beijing's largesse. Research shows that PICs choose to cooperate with China on certain fronts."
