            "summary": "Researchers claim that Arctic ice levels can impact the world, which can be felt in North America and Europe. The impact is a consequence of ice cover becoming thin and altering how heat is transferred between the ocean and the atmosphere. The change in pattern of the jet stream also encourages the wind to move towards the south. This direction of wind movement can cause temperatures to fall sharply in large areas of the United States and facilitate heavy snowfall in the Great Lakes region."
