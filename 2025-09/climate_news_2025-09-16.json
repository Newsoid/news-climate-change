Michaels' new book, \"Meltdown: The Predictable Distortion of Global Warming by Scientists, Politicians, and the Media,\" questions the prevailing narrative on global warming. He argues that it is exaggerated and distorted by scientific practices, political influences and media portrayals. He also criticizes the competitive nature of scientific funding, which prioritizes alarmist predictions over more measured assessments. Some scientists argue that he downplays the risks of global warming and that his book is selective."
