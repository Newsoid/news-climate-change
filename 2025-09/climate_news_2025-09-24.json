The study compared the recent past (1991–2020) with the near future (2021–2050) under various warming and population growth scenarios. Its findings highlight stark insights as heat-related extremes concurrent with floods or droughts are projected to rise sharply worldwide. Asia and Africa are set to be the hardest hit, with children and working-age adults facing the greatest risk. Sub-Saharan Africa will experience the highest youth exposure to extremes due to rapid population growth, while in Europe, North America and Australia the elderly are most vulnerable."
