The Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage (FRLD) aims to provide financial support to vulnerable countries affected by climate disasters."

The loss of this year's harvest will force Pakistan to import vast quantities of wheat, vegetables, and cotton, straining foreign exchange reserves and driving up the import bill."

There were 354 deaths linked to extreme heat between 2001 and 2018 and 2000 hospitalisations between 2019 and 2021. The risk assessment warns that the figures could rise by 400 per cent in some capitals if temperatures are not kept under 3.0C. Even keeping temperatures lower will increase deaths by up to 200 per cent at 1.5C."
