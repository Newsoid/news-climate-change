The catastrophic monsoon floods of 2025 have submerged vast swathes of the country, displacing millions, wrecking farmland, and wiping out critical infrastructure. In Punjab alone, 80% of the wheat production is at risk, while Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa has lost tens of thousands of acres of maize and vegetables. The loss of this year's harvest will force Pakistan to import vast quantities of wheat, vegetables, and cotton, straining foreign exchange reserves and driving up the import bill."

Key crops such as rice, sugarcane, cotton, and maize have been severely impacted, with early assessments suggesting a 15-20% drop in output in affected areas.
