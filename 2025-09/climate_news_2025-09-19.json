Most of these children work in informal sectors under hazardous conditions, facing health risks, exploitation, and limited prospects for education. Climate-induced disasters degrade livelihoods, displace communities, and push children into labour. Climate adaptation funding rarely integrates child protection measures."

This proportion is projected to increase to 13.5% by 2090 in a scenario with a high global warming level."

The abnormally warm ocean water is getting a boost from human-caused global warming. There have been multiple die-offs of marine mammals, seabirds and forage fish in Alaskan waters this summer."

This decline of summer sea ice area has a multitude of effects. For people living along the Arctic Ocean coast in Alaska, winter sea ice will still return for now, if global greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced."
