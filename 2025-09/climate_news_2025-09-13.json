Since late June 2025, heavy monsoon rains and flash floods have killed at least 739 people, displaced thousands, and destroyed homes and crops across the country. Karachi alone saw rainfall levels in August 2025 near the airport reach 163.5 mm, the highest since 1979. Islamabad/Rawalpindi generate over 2,000 tonnes of solid waste per day. Private housing societies should adopt climate-resilient waste practices."
